{% include base_path %}

I am currently a PhD candidate in the [@REDI Dual-PhD Program]([https://www.rediprogram.eu/]), jointly hosted by Eindhoven University of Technology (The Netherlands) and RMIT University (Australia), and funded by the Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Actions (MSCA) under the Horizon Europe programme. 

My research explores the interaction design of Human Digital Twins in preventive health context, with a focus on roles, embodiment, and long-term human-digital twin relationships. I am supervised by Prof. Regina Bernhaupt (TU/e), Asst. Prof. Carine Lallemand (TU/e), Prof. Laurene Vaughan (RMIT), Dr. Liam Fennessy (RMIT) and Dr. Scott Mitchell (RMIT).

I hold an MSc in Human-Computer Interaction from Uppsala University (Sweden), where I developed interests in embodied interaction and design for everyday digital experiences. I have my BSc in Information Management and Information Systems from Huazhong University of Science and Technology (China), which provided me with technical and analytical skills in information systems and data management.
