ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m **Yinchu Li**, a PhD candidate enrolled in the **REDI Dual-PhD Program** at  
[@TUE_ID (Eindhoven University of Technology)](https://www.tue.nl/en/) and  
[@RMIT (Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology)](https://www.rmit.edu.au/),  
funded by [@MSCActions](https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/) and [@HorizonEU](https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/funding/funding-opportunities/funding-programmes-and-open-calls/horizon-europe_en).

My PhD research explores the **application of Human Digital Twins in preventive health**, with a focus on how individuals interact with their digital counterparts over time. I investigate the design of long-term relationships between people and predictive systems, including how embodiment, relational agency, and material representation influence understanding and trust.

I'm particularly interested in:
- Human-data interaction and interactive materials  
- Embodied and speculative design methodologies  
- Tangible and multisensory representations of predictive data  

Presenting data in new ways â€” to facilitate understanding and promote reflective interaction â€” has always been at the heart of my work.
