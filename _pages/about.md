Hello!ðŸ‘‹ I'm Yinchu â€” a design researcher exploring how we might relate to digital representations of ourselves or our health in more meaningful, embodied, and personally relevant ways. I hold an interdisciplinary background spanning information systems and human-computer interaction. Currently, I'm pursuing my PhD in the **REDI Dual-PhD Program** between **Eindhoven University of Technology** (TU/e) and **RMIT University**, funded by **Marie SkÅ‚odowska-Curie Actions** under **Horizon Europe**. My work builds on speculative design, embodied interaction, and post-phenomenological perspectives to rethink the future forms and interactions with our digital twin.

Specifically, my research focuses on the interaction design of **Human Digital Twins** in the context of **preventive health**. I investigate how we can move beyond purely data-driven interfaces toward forms of interaction that are **expressive, meaningful, and relational**. Through speculative and embodied approaches, I explore how digital twins might act not only as data visualizers, but as relational counterparts, such as shadow, future teller, living memories.

Presenting health information in new ways â€” to facilitate understanding and promote reflective interaction â€” has always been at the heart of my work. I am particularly interested in:
- Human-data interaction and interactive materials  
- Embodied and speculative design methodologies  
- Tangible and multisensory representations of predictive data  

Outside of research, I enjoy cooking, crocheting, travelling and finding meanings in everyday materials. You can reach me at y.li1@tue.nl or through my "digital twin" on [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/yinchu_design_research?igsh=MWo1aGZibXAydjAxZA%3D%3D&utm_source=qr). I'm always up for a fika! ðŸ«–â˜•
